Description: Nano IDs are comparable to UUID v4 (random-based). They have a similar number of random
    bits in the ID (126 in Nano ID and 122 in UUID), so they have similar collision probabilities.
    Nano ID also use a bigger alphabet, so a similar number of random bits are packed in just 21 
    symbols instead of 36. The C++ code implements the algorithm specified by Andrey Sitnik.
